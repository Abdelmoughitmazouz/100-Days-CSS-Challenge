### Introduction

As part of the `"100-Days-CSS-Challenge"` I wanted to challenge myself by recreating a design I saw on [Relume.io](https://www.relume.io/). The concept featured a horizontal row of profile images with an animation that responded to user interaction. It immediately caught my attention, and I knew I had to give it a shot. This attempt was not just about copying the visuals but also about understanding the underlying `CSS` techniques and improving my animation skills.

### The Process

I began by carefully analyzing the design to break it down into smaller, manageable pieces. The core of the project was to create a clean horizontal layout of circular profile images and apply a smooth hover effect that would make each image pop out slightly when hovered over.

Here are the steps I followed:
1. HTML Structure: I created a simple container to hold the images and used the `<img>` tag for each profile picture.
2. CSS Styling: I applied `border-radius` to make the images circular and styled the container to center everything on the page.
3. Hover Animation: Using `transform: scale()` and `transition`, I added the hover effect that gives the animation its smooth and dynamic feel.
4. Fine-Tuning: Adjusting the scaling, transition timing, and spacing between the images to ensure everything looked polished.

### Challenges and Solutions

One of the biggest challenges I faced was getting the hover animation to feel natural and responsive. Initially, the scaling effect was too abrupt, which made the design feel rigid. To solve this, I experimented with different `transition` values, ultimately settling on `ease-out` for a more fluid and professional look.

Another issue was ensuring the layout remained centered and consistent across different screen sizes. I addressed this by using `flexbox` properties like `justify-content` and `align-items`. This helped me achieve a responsive design that adapts well to various viewport widths.

### Personal Reflection

Working on this project was both exciting and frustrating at times. I felt a sense of accomplishment when the hover animation finally worked the way I wanted. However, there were moments of doubt when I struggled to get the layout just right. Overall, this challenge reinforced my belief in the importance of patience and practice when learning CSS. It also made me more confident in using CSS animations and transitions.

### Conclusion

Recreating this design was a rewarding experience that pushed me to explore new techniques and refine my skills. I’m proud of what I achieved, and this project has motivated me to take on more complex challenges in the future. For my next challenge, I’m considering experimenting with keyframe animations or a dynamic grid layout.

Reflecting on this journey, I’m excited about the progress I’m making and can’t wait to see how far I’ll go by the end of the "100-Days-CSS-Challenge."
